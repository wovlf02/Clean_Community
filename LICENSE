## 2. Open Source Components

This project incorporates the following open-source software, each governed by its original license:

### 2.1 Datasets & Models (CC BY-SA 4.0)

- **UnSmile Dataset** by Smilegate AI
- **KLUE-RoBERTa** by KLUE Team

**Our Compliance:**
- ✅ Attribution provided in NOTICE.md
- ✅ Source and license clearly stated
- ⚠️ **Important:** CC BY-SA 4.0 ShareAlike applies ONLY if you redistribute the original dataset or model weights. Our trained model weights are derivative works and are licensed separately as proprietary.

**Legal Interpretation:**
Under CC BY-SA 4.0, the ShareAlike requirement applies to redistribution of the licensed material. When used as input to create a new work (trained model), the ShareAlike does NOT automatically extend to the new work. This is consistent with how CC licenses are interpreted in ML contexts.

### 2.2 Pre-trained Models (Apache 2.0)

- **KcELECTRA** by Junbum Lee (beomi)
- **SoongsilBERT** by Soongsil University AI Lab

**Our Compliance:**
- ✅ Attribution provided
- ✅ Original license notices preserved
- ✅ Changes documented
- ✅ Apache 2.0 allows proprietary derivative works

### 2.3 Libraries & Frameworks

| Component | License | Compliance |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| PyTorch | BSD-3-Clause | ✅ Attribution in NOTICE.md |
| Transformers | Apache-2.0 | ✅ Attribution in NOTICE.md |
| Next.js | MIT | ✅ Attribution in NOTICE.md |
| React | MIT | ✅ Attribution in NOTICE.md |
| FastAPI | MIT | ✅ Attribution in NOTICE.md |

**All open-source licenses are fully complied with.**

See [NOTICE.md](./NOTICE.md) for complete attribution.

## 3. Our Derivative Works

### 3.1 Trained Model Weights

Our trained model weights (`.pt` files) are **proprietary** and subject to this license, NOT the original dataset/model licenses.

**Legal Basis:**
- Trained weights are new copyrightable works
- Training on CC BY-SA data does NOT make weights CC BY-SA
- Analogous to: Training on a book doesn't make your brain CC BY-SA

### 3.2 Custom Code

All code written by us is **proprietary** and covered by Section 1 above.
